      <p>
        We’re out to solve a common problem that is hindering work in too many
        places. Companies are looking for help and people are looking for jobs.
        But for a variety of reasons, the search for both parties can be long
        and hard. We get it. We built Springboard based on our many years in the
        staffing industry, our understanding of how the gig economy is changing
        today’s workforce, and our success at creating a platform for matching
        employers and workers in the healthcare industry. We’ve made the leap
        from old school staffing to a tech-enabled approach that enables
        employee-employer matches on an exponentially larger scale. We’re now
        ready to take this same proven solution to other industries to help more
        employers and job-seekers with their work-related needs.
